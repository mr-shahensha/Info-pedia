                        Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 â€“ 1 February 2003) was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first woman of Indian origin to go to space.[3][4] She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a
                         mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. In 2003, Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry 
                         into the Earth's atmosphere.[5] Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor,[6] and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her honor.[7][8][9] She is regarded as a national hero in India.
                         Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962, in Karnal of present-day Haryana, India, but her official date of birth was altered to 1 July 1961, to allow her to become eligible for the matriculation exam.[11] As a child, she was fascinated by aeroplanes
                          and flying.[12] She went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.[13] After getting a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a
                           Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.[14] Chawla went on to earn a second Masters in 1986 and a PhD[15] in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.
Chawla was married to Jean-Pierre Harrison.
